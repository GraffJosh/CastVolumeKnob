# CastVolumeKnob
This project is based on the ESP8266 microcontroller, made to control the volume/playback on Chromecast Audio enabled devices.

## The Problem:
* I have multiple Chromecast Audio devices which are required to use a phone to control.
* I need a device, I can control the volume of all my Chomecasts.
* Preferrably it needs to be just a turning knob with a clickable button.
* Needs to be battery powered and wireless.
